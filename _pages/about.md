I am a South African PhD student studying at the University of Liverpool. My current areas of research include Mathematical Finance and Levy Fluctuation Theory.

In general, I am interested in many different areas in probability and enjoy learning about new aspects of these areas in my free time. In particular, I am learning about Gaussian Free Fields, Liouville Quantum Gravity and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations in my spare time and would be grateful for any guidance/suggestions about these areas.

For any questions or ideas about my research, please feel free to contact me via email: n.beelders@liverpool.ac.uk
